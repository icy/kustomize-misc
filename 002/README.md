## Description

In `kustomize-3.8.5` an overlay patch can interfere with `images:`
transformer in `base` and generate completely wrong output.

In our test (https://github.com/icy/kustomize-misc/tree/master/002),
`base/kustomization.yaml` specifies a transformer

```
images:
- name: bflux
  newName: devops
  newTag: bflux-v1.8.128
```

and in `overlay/kustomization.yaml` there is to modify the same deployment

```
resources:
- ../base/
patches:
- patches.yaml
```

## Expected output

Image transformer result from `base` is reflected in the overlay.
`kustomize-3.8.2` works as expected. The `envs:` section in the
base manifest is kept, and the following `diff` command generates no-diff:

```
$ colordiff <(kust382 build overlay/) <(kust385 build overlay/)
```

## Actual output

The output generated by `kustomize-3.8.5` doesn't include any result
from `images:` transformer. The `envs:` section in base manifest
is gone:


```
$ colordiff <(kust382 build overlay/) <(kust385 build overlay/)
24,28d23
<         envs:
<         - name: FOO
<           value: BAR
<         image: devops:bflux-v1.8.128
<         imagePullPolicy: Always
```
