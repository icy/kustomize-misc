## Description

In `kustomize-3.8.5` an overlay patch can interfere with `images:`
transformer in `base` and generate completely wrong output.

In our POC, `base/kustomization.yaml` specifies a transformer

```
images:
- name: bflux
  newName: devops
  newTag: bflux-v1.8.128
```

and in `overlay/kustomization.yaml` there is to modify the same deployment

```
resources:
- ../base/
patches:
- patches.yaml
```

## Expected output

Image transformer result from `base` is reflected in the overlay.
`kustomize-3.8.2` works as expected.

## Actual output

The output generated by `kustomize-3.8.5` doesn't include any result
from `images:` transformer
