## Description

In `kustomize-3.8.5` an overlay patch can interfere with `images:`
transformer in `base` and generate completely wrong output.

In our test (https://github.com/icy/kustomize-misc/tree/master/002),
`base/kustomization.yaml` specifies a transformer

```
images:
- name: bflux
  newName: devops
  newTag: bflux-v1.8.128
```

and in `overlay/kustomization.yaml` there is to modify the same deployment

```
resources:
- ../base/
patches:
- patches.yaml
```

## Expected output

Image transformer result from `base` is reflected in the overlay.
`kustomize-3.8.2` works as expected. The `env:` section in the
base manifest is kept, and the following `diff` command generates no-diff:

```
$ colordiff <(kust382 build overlay/) <(kust385 build overlay/)
```

## Actual output

The output generated by `kustomize-3.8.5` doesn't include any result
from `images:` transformer. The `env:` section in base manifest
is gone:


```
$ colordiff <(kust382 build overlay/) <(kust385 build overlay/)
22,23d21
<         - name: FOO
<           value: BAR
26,27d23
<         image: devops:bflux-v1.8.128
<         imagePullPolicy: Always
```

## Platform

```
$ kust385 version
{Version:kustomize/v3.8.5 GitCommit:4052cd4fd8c76a17b5f64e32509f3fba9713fe75 BuildDate:2020-10-08T02:45:59Z GoOs:linux GoArch:amd64}
```

## Updates

Actually it isn't a problem of the `images:` transformer.
When I remove the transformer from `base`/ I can see the same diff

```
$ colordiff <(kust382 build overlay/) <(kust385 build overlay/)
22,23d21
<         - name: FOO
<           value: BAR
26,27d23
<         image: bflux
<         imagePullPolicy: Always
```

I suspect that the behavior of `patches` has changed quite a lot,
and that doesn't merge: it replaces things from `base/`
